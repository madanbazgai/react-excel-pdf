Imagine you're making a sandwich-making robot. This robot has its own brain where it knows what's happening and what to do next. Let's break down the terms:

State: Think of the state like the robot's memory. It's like a piece of paper where the robot writes down everything important about the sandwich. This paper helps the robot remember things like whether it has bread, peanut butter, jelly, and if it's already made a sandwich or not.

Action: An action is like a command you give to the robot. It's like telling the robot, "Put peanut butter on the bread" or "Take two slices of bread." Each action is like a small job the robot needs to do.

Dispatch: Dispatching is when the robot gets a new job to do. It's like when you tell the robot to do something, like "Spread jelly on the bread." The robot listens for your instructions and does the tasks you tell it to do.

Reducer: The reducer is like the robot's helper. When the robot gets a job to do (a dispatch), the reducer helps the robot figure out what to change on its piece of paper (the state). It makes sure the robot remembers everything correctly and updates the state properly.

So, when you want your sandwich-making robot to work, you tell it what to do (dispatch), and it follows those instructions and keeps track of what it's doing (state) with the help of its helper (reducer). Just like that, you can make your perfect peanut butter and jelly sandwich, step by step!
